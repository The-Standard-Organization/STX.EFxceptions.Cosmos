# STX.EFxceptions.Cosmos

## Introduction
A Standardized .NET library that captures the exceptions thrown by the EntityFramework from a Cosmos DB and converts them into meaningful exceptions...

## STX. EFXceptions.Core Implementation

[STX.EFxceptions.Core](https://github.com/The-Standard-Organization/STX.EFxceptions.Core)

## Standard-Compliance
This library was built according to The Standard. The library follows engineering principles, patterns and tooling as recommended by The Standard.

This library is also a community effort which involved many nights of pair-programming, test-driven development and in-depth exploration research and design discussions.

## Standard-Promise
The most important fulfillment aspect in a Standard complaint system is aimed towards contributing to people, its evolution, and principles.
An organization that systematically honors an environment of learning, training, and sharing knowledge is an organization that learns from the past, makes calculated risks for the future, 
and brings everyone within it up to speed on the current state of things as honestly, rapidly, and efficiently as possible. 
 
We believe that everyone has the right to privacy, and will never do anything that could violate that right.
We are committed to writing ethical and responsible software, and will always strive to use our skills, coding, and systems for the good.
We believe that these beliefs will help to ensure that our software(s) are safe and secure and that it will never be used to harm or collect personal data for malicious purposes.
 
The Standard Community as a promise to you is in upholding these values.

## Current Outlook of the Project
In the outset of this endeavor we plan to re-write the existing popular library RESTFulSense to enhance and bring current to modern Standard compliancy.
